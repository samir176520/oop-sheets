# OOP Sheets Repository  

## 📖 Overview  
This repository contains solutions to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) problem sheets assigned during my coursework at the **Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University**.  
It serves as a collection of well-documented examples, exercises, and solutions that demonstrate key OOP concepts in **C++**.  

---

## 🧩 Features  

- **Organized Sheets**: Each problem sheet is placed in its respective folder for easy navigation.  
- **Detailed Explanations**: Solutions include comments to explain the logic behind the implementation.  
- **Practical Examples**: Includes real-world applications of OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

2. Navigate to the folder containing the desired sheet and file.  

3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`):  
   ```bash
   g++ Problem1.cpp -o Problem1
   ./Problem1
   ```
