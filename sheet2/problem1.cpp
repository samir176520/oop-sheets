/*
Write a program :
1.defines two structures Data and Employee. 
    1.1.Date has data members: name (int), age (float), salary (float), tax (float).
    1.2.Employee has data members: E (Data) net_s(float), 
        1.2.1.function to read data members and set the value of the net_s(net salary),
        1.2.2. function to display data members.
2.in this program write a function to swap two Employee objects 
3.In main function, define an array of m Employees, read it, 
    sort it in ascending order according to the value of net_s (use swap function), 
    3.1.compute the difference between the min and max net salaries. 
    3.2.Finally, display the elements of array in a tabular form.
