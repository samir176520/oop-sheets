/*
Write a program contains 
1.structure Point that has data members: x, y, z as float. 
2.class Point_3D that has data members: 
    2.1.P[30](Point), N[30] (float), and m(number of elements for P,N). 
This class includes :
    2.2.function to return the norm for a given Pointâ€™s object,
    2.3.function to read data members and set the elements of N.
        such that each Ni is the norm of point Pi for i=0, .. , m-1.
    2.4.function to return the distance between the first and last points in P.
    2.5.function to return the max norm in N.
    2.6.function to compare between max norm for two objects and return the max object. 
    2.7.function to return the minimum distance for first and last points for two objects.
    2.8.function to display the data members in tabular form.
3.In main function, define two object of class Point_3D, and apply all functions on them.
